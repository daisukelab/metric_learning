# Metric Learning Application System Development Resource

This repository is working in progress, currently contains notebooks for:

- Benchmarks of various deep metric learnings by Anomaly Detection problem setting.
- Visualization of failure case of the benchmarks.
- t-SNE embeddings visualization of deep metric learnings.

If this repository could be lucky, this will grow to have:

- Utilities and/or library for metric learning applications.
- Test/benchmark resources summary.
- Links for resources.
