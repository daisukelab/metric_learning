# Metric Learning Application System Development Resource

This repository is a work in progress, currently contains notebooks for:

- Benchmarks of various deep metric learnings by Anomaly Detection problem setting.
- Visualizations of failure cases of the benchmarks.
- t-SNE embeddings visualizations of deep metric learnings.

If this repository could get lucky, will grow to have:

- Utilities and/or library for metric learning applications.
- Test/benchmark resources summary.
- Links for resources.
